## Problem Statement

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban, and rural areas. Customer first applies for a home loan and after that company validates the customer eligibility for the loan.
A marketing firm wants to launch a promotional campaign in different regions of the country. So, in order to do that, they need to understand which areas they should focus their resources in order to cover the entire region. We are provided with the population data based on different locations along with the demographics. The objective is to segregate the regions into different groups so that the marketing team can plan their resources accordingly. So, we have to apply classification techniques in order to segregate the regions into different clusters which will help the marketing team.
